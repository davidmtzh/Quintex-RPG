# Quintex - RPG (Unity)
Quintex RPG is a collaborative role-playing game project developed as part of our teamâ€™s effort to combine storytelling, gameplay design, and technical skills into a single interactive experience. The game places players in a dynamic world where they can explore puzzles, and engage in real-time combat.

From a development perspective, the project focused on:

      Animation: Designing and implementing sprite-based animations for characters and environments.

      Scripting: Writing custom logic for combat, dialogue, and quest systems.

      Version Control: Using Git and GitHub for collaborative development, branch management, and conflict resolution.

      Teamwork: Coordinating as a development team to assign tasks, merge work, and build a cohesive product.

ðŸ“‚ Evidence & APK Access

      The APK build of the game will be included in the Evidence folder for review.

      Inside the folder, you will also find supporting materials such as videos, source files, and development               notes that document our process.

ðŸš€ Future Plans

While Quintex RPG is not currently deployed on any platform, the team plans to release a playable demo featuring a more polished combat system and expanded gameplay. This version will serve as the foundation for a future public release.
